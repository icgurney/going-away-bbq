This is a quick e-invitation I created for a party.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). You can read more about here in [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is a utility class css framework. It also utilizes some of the official plugins for some opinionated styling on typography, forms, and aspect ratios. Check out `tailwind.config.js ` for configuration of the design system. It allowed me to iterate quickly on changes. You can read more in the [Tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs). 

## Deployment

This project is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The Netlify form definition allows `post` request data to be tracked. You can read more in the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/).
