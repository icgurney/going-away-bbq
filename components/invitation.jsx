          <h2>We are moving to Denver! üèî</h2>
          <p>
            We are excited to start a new journey together as we explore the
            Rockies and all Denver has to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But before we go...</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like friends and family to join us for a casual
            get-together at our place.
          </p>
          <p>We will have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Burgers üçî & weiners üå≠</li>
            <li>Some beers üçª</li>
            <li>Maybe even a watermelon üçâ</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And I&apos;m sure some other surprises! But really, bring anything
            you would like to go with burgers or to drink.
